Engineering Economy is a book that emphasizes the concepts and techniques of analysis that prove useful in evaluating the economic feasibility of engineering systems, projects, and services for decision purposes. It also familiarizes the engineer with operations and operational feasibility necessary to considerations of the design process[^4^] [^5^].
 
The book covers topics such as economic and cost concepts, interest formulas and equivalence, economic analysis of alternatives, accounting, depreciation, and income taxes, decisions under risk and uncertainty and involving multiple criteria, and estimating economic elements. The book is divided into six parts, each with several chapters that provide examples, exercises, and case studies to illustrate the concepts and methods[^5^].

The book is written by G. J. Thuesen and W. J. Fabrycky, who are both professors of industrial and systems engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The book is based on the previous editions by H. G. Thuesen, W. J. Fabrycky, and G. J. Thuesen[^5^]. The book is intended for undergraduate and graduate students of engineering, as well as practicing engineers who need to apply economic analysis to their work[^4^].
 
Engineering Economy is a comprehensive and rigorous text that provides a solid foundation for engineering economic analysis. It is suitable for both self-study and classroom use. The book is well-organized, clear, and up-to-date with current practices and standards. The book also includes a companion website that offers additional resources and software tools for students and instructors[^4^].
 
Engineering Economy is a valuable reference for anyone who wants to learn how to evaluate the economic aspects of engineering problems and solutions. It is also a useful guide for engineers who want to improve their decision-making skills and optimize their performance in complex operational systems.
  
One of the strengths of Engineering Economy is its use of real-world examples and case studies that illustrate the application of economic analysis to various engineering domains. The book covers topics such as energy systems, transportation systems, manufacturing systems, environmental systems, and service systems. The book also shows how to deal with uncertainty, risk, and multiple criteria in decision-making.

Another strength of Engineering Economy is its integration of spreadsheet software and other computational tools that facilitate the calculations and comparisons of economic alternatives. The book provides step-by-step instructions and screenshots for using Microsoft Excel and other software packages to perform economic analysis. The book also offers online access to spreadsheets, data sets, and solutions for selected problems.
 
A limitation of Engineering Economy is that it assumes a basic knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and engineering principles. The book does not provide much background or review of these topics, so readers who are not familiar with them may need to consult other sources or seek additional help. The book also uses some technical terms and symbols that may not be explained clearly or consistently throughout the text.
